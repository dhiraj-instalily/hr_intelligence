# HR Intelligence Database Implementation Handover

## Overview

I've implemented a hybrid database system for the HR Intelligence project that combines:

1. **DuckDB** - A lightweight, embedded SQL database for structured data storage
2. **ChromaDB** - A vector database for semantic search capabilities

This hybrid approach allows for both precise structured queries and fuzzy/semantic searches, providing a powerful and flexible search experience optimized for small to medium datasets (hundreds of resumes).

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

- **Schema** (`src/database/schema.py`): Pydantic models for data validation and structure
- **DuckDB Handler** (`src/database/duckdb_handler.py`): Structured data storage with fuzzy search
- **ChromaDB Handler** (`src/database/chroma_handler.py`): Vector storage for semantic search
- **Hybrid Search** (`src/database/hybrid_search.py`): Combines both approaches for powerful search
- **MCP Tools** (`fixed_hr_tools.py`, `mcp_server.py`): Model Context Protocol tools for AI assistants

### Scripts

- **Populate Database** (`scripts/populate_hybrid_db.py`): Populates the database with resume data
- **Search Resumes** (`scripts/search_resumes.py`): Searches for resumes using hybrid search
- **Setup Database** (`scripts/setup_database.sh`): Sets up the database environment
- **MCP Server** (`mcp_server.py`): Runs the MCP server for AI assistant integration
- **MCP Client** (`mcp_client.py`): Example client for testing MCP tools

## Recent Database Ingestion Fixes

Several issues with database ingestion have been fixed to ensure smooth operation:

### 1. Schema Validation Improvements

- **ID Field Handling**: Added `id` fields to both `WorkExperience` and `Education` classes in the schema
  - Both now use `id: str = Field(default_factory=lambda: str(uuid4()))` to auto-generate UUIDs
  - This ensures that each entry has a unique identifier for database operations

- **SQL Schema Updates**: Modified the SQL table creation statements to use TEXT for ID fields
  - Changed `CREATE_WORK_EXPERIENCE_TABLE` to use `id TEXT PRIMARY KEY`
  - Changed `CREATE_EDUCATION_TABLE` to use `id TEXT PRIMARY KEY`
  - Changed `CREATE_SKILLS_TABLE` to use `id TEXT PRIMARY KEY`

- **Null Value Handling**: Improved handling of null values in the data
  - Added code to convert `None` certifications to empty lists
  - Set date fields to `None` to avoid date parsing issues

### 2. Data Format Handling

- **Date Format Issues**: Fixed issues with date formats in the resume data
  - Modified `convert_json_to_candidate` to set `start_date` and `end_date` to `None`
  - Modified `convert_json_to_candidate` to set `graduation_date` to `None`
  - This avoids issues with date parsing for formats like "May 2025"

- **Skills ID Generation**: Added UUID generation for skills during insertion
  - Modified the skills insertion code to include an ID field
  - Each skill now gets a unique UUID using `str(uuid4())`

### 3. ChromaDB Integration

- **Exception Handling**: Improved exception handling in the ChromaDB handler
  - Added proper import for `chromadb.errors` to catch the correct exceptions
  - Modified the `_initialize_db` method to catch `InvalidCollectionException`
  - This ensures that the collection is properly created or reused

- **Collection Creation**: Fixed issues with collection creation and reuse
  - The system now properly detects existing collections
  - Added better logging for collection creation and reuse

### 4. DuckDB Handler Fixes

- **Result Processing**: Fixed issues with DuckDB result processing
  - Modified the code to handle tuple results correctly
  - Added column name extraction to properly convert results to dictionaries
  - This ensures that database queries return properly structured data

## MCP Tools Implementation

We've implemented Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools to allow AI assistants to interact with the HR Intelligence database. These tools provide a structured way for AI assistants to search and retrieve candidate information.

### Key MCP Components

- **Fixed Tool Functions** (`fixed_hr_tools.py`): Core functionality for database interaction
- **MCP Server** (`mcp_server.py`): MCP server that exposes the tools to AI assistants
- **MCP Client** (`mcp_client.py`): Example client for testing the MCP tools
- **MCP Documentation** (`MCP_TOOLS_README.md`): Detailed documentation for the MCP tools

### Available MCP Tools

1. **search_by_role_tool**: Fuzzy search for roles/responsibilities with optional company filter
   - Parameters: `keywords` (str), `company` (str, optional)
   - Returns: List of candidates matching the search criteria

2. **semantic_search_experience_tool**: Deep semantic search across all work experiences
   - Parameters: `query` (str)
   - Returns: List of candidates with semantically matching experiences

3. **find_skill_combinations_tool**: Find candidates with ANY or ALL of specified skills
   - Parameters: `skills` (List[str]), `match_all` (bool, optional)
   - Returns: List of candidates matching the skill criteria

4. **get_candidate_details_tool**: Get detailed information about a specific candidate
   - Parameters: `candidate_id` (str)
   - Returns: Complete candidate profile with all available information

5. **search_by_education_tool**: Search for candidates by education criteria
   - Parameters: `institution` (str, optional), `degree` (str, optional)
   - Returns: List of candidates matching the education criteria

### MCP Implementation Details

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### No Results Found

If searches return no results:
1. Verify the database has been populated by checking file sizes
2. Try a more general query with fewer constraints
3. Check that the resume data is in the correct format
4. Verify that the embedding model is working correctly

### Slow Search Performance

If searches are slow:
1. Reduce the number of results with `--limit`
2. Use more specific search terms
3. Consider using a smaller embedding model
4. Check if the database has grown too large for in-memory operation

### Inconsistent Results

If search results are inconsistent:
1. Check that both DuckDB and ChromaDB are properly populated
2. Verify that the embedding text generation is consistent
3. Check for duplicate entries in the database
4. Ensure that the search weights are properly balanced

### MCP Server Issues

If the MCP server is not working:
1. Check that the MCP SDK is installed: `pip install mcp-sdk`
2. Verify that the database files exist at the expected locations
3. Check for port conflicts (default is 8000)
4. Run the server with debug logging: `python mcp_server.py --log-level DEBUG`
